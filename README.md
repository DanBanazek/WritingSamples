MyECFMail AutoDownloadController API
------------------------------------
In version 3 of MyECFMail, we gave users the options to create a Windows Task to run a daily mail download.
The actual coding was split into three parts. A simple console app to run the task remotely, a Winforms dll with a GUI setup for MyECFMail users
and a AutoDownloadControllers.dll that contains the classes and methods for creating and running the task. The MyECFMail AutoDownloadController API Reference
is an reference guide I created to help myself and others who may need to edit or enhance the methods in the future. It was generated through SandCastle with a Visual Studio XML
file.
