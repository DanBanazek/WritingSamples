Technical Writing Samples
==========================================

Welcome to my writing samples repository. 

###MyECFMail AutoDownloadController API Reference
In version 3 of MyECFMail, we gave users the option to create a Windows Task to run a daily mail download.
The actual coding was split into three parts. A simple console app to run the task remotely, a Winforms dll with a GUI setup for MyECFMail users
and a AutoDownloadControllers.dll that contains the classes and methods for creating and running the task. The MyECFMail AutoDownloadController API Reference
is an reference guide I created to help myself and others who may need to edit or enhance the methods in the future. It was generated through SandCastle with a Visual Studio XML
file.

###MyECFMail Testing and Tech Support Instructions

*	How to Mock a MyECFMail Calendar Events Auto-Transfer from the Session Manager

Part of my role as a lead developer of MyECFMail is coming up with testing plans and scripts for tech support workers. 
This document is a set of instructions I wrote for an Internal Wiki used for testing and supporting MyECFMail. 
The Session Manager referenced in the instructions is a special .exe I wrote that ships with MyECFMail. It contains a suite of tools front line tech support uses to diagnose and solve common MyECFMail issues.

###Best Case Solutions Help File
In 2006 I spearheaded the upgrade of the help file for Best Case Bankruptcy from ForeHelp to RoboHelp. This included designing basic pages, creating css files to manage layout and some javascript work
to recreate missing forehelp functionality. Additionally I wrote wrote and maintained a large portion of the help file including the following topics:

*	Scanning a Document into Your ECF Manager with BestScan
*	Geting Started with the Means Test Calculator
*	Form 3B. Application to Have the Chapter 7 Filing Fee Waived

###Chapter 13 Plan Add-On Instructions
The standard Chapter 13 Plan Document created by Best Case Bankruptcy is not excepted in all courts. To accomodate non-standard districts Best Case offers District Specific Chapter 13 Plan Documents.
Each of these documents includes its own set of instructions available in PDF format. As part of my Technical Writer duties, I not only wrote several sets of instructions, I also created standards and a reference library
to make the process of creating these documents faster. I have included two samples in this repository.

*	District of Colorado Custom Chapter 13 Plan Instructions
*	Northern District of Georgia Chapter 13 Plan Instructions
